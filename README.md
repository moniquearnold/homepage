- 👋 Hi, I’m @moniquearnold
- 🤓 I'm a 4th year medical student at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine. I'm from Kingston, Jamaica.
- 👀 I’m interested in data science (obviously) and beautiful data visualization, clinical informatics, emergency medicine and pop culture.
- 🌱 I’m currently applying to Emergency Medicine Residency and taking a data science course at Upenn. I really want to work on data visualization and APIs.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything fun :)
